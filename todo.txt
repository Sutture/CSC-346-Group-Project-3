	databaseAdaptor php class functions needed:
		-searchGames(): looks through all games, tries to find a game that has only one player.  
					if this exists, returns the game ID, 
					if this doesnt exist (all games are full), it creates a new game in the database, and assigns the player to it
	
		-displayBoard(): return a 2d integer array containing the board state (0s are empty, 1s are red pieces, 2s are black pieces)
		
		-move(currentX, currentY, targetX, targetY): given two sets of coordinates, move the piece from the first to the second.  if an opponents piece was in between the locations, remove it.  then, call displayBoard()
